Task Completed!
Iâ€™m glad to share that I have successfully completed the Calculator project as part of my CodSoft Internship in Python Development.
This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in user input handling, arithmetic operations, and program logic implementation while creating a simple yet functional calculator.

Thank you to CodSoft for this great opportunity to enhance my coding knowledge through practical projects!
